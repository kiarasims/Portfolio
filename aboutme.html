                <p>I was born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana. Graduated from Xaviver University of Louisiana in May 2022. 
                Currently, I am a software developer at IBM Baton Rouge CIC. While working I will be in school to obtain a 
                Masters Degree in Computer Science. Things will be challenging for me. However, I love a good challenge.
                Anything is possible once your mind is set on it.
