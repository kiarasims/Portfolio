                <p>I was born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana. Graduated from Xaviver University of Louisiana in
                    May 2022.
                    Currently, I am a software developer at IBM Baton Rouge CIC. While working I will be in school to
                    obtain a
                    Masters Degree in Computer Science. Things will be challenging for me. However, I love a good
                    challenge.
                    Anything is possible once your mind is set on it.

                Before deciding to go to school for Computer Science, I was going to go to school for fashion design.
                My sister and brother-in-law convinced me to give coding a try. Me not knowing if I would love it or
                not;
                actually ended up loving it.

                Blue is my favorite color. Many artist associate blue as a sad color. To me blue is a calming color.
                Although, it depends on how it is used.
